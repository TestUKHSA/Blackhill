	<p><h1>1<sup><small>st</small></sup> Blackhill Beavers, Cubs and Scouts</h1></p>

	<p><b>We are based in Blackhill and Consett in the Derwentside District in County Durham, 
		providing fun, challenge, and everyday adventure to young people from 6 - 14.</b></p>
	
	<p><b>Beavers</b>: 6 to 8 years old. Meet each Tuesday during term time from 6 to 7pm. 
		The leaders are Donna Tunney and Stephen Etherington.</p>

	<p><b>Cubs</b>: 8 to 10<span>&#189;</span> years old. Meet each Tuesday during term time from 6:30 to 8. 
		The leaders are Katt Rutter and Tim Rutter.</p>

	<p><b>Scouts</b>: 10<span>&#189;</span> to 14 years old. Meet each Tuesday (at present) during term time from 7:30 to 9. The leader is Rob Chester.</p>

	<p>We do still need more helpers on a rota to allow sections to grow and to make camps easier to run.</p>

	<p>At present we don't run a <a href="https://www.scouts.org.uk/squirrels/" target="_blank">Squirrels</a> (4 and 5 years old) section, 
	but contact us if you wish to discuss.</p>

	<p>All sections meet at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/54.85220,-1.83627/@54.85220,-1.83627,18z" target="Map Link">Scout HQ, Constance Street, Consett DH8 5DU (Google Maps link)</a>which we own jointly with Consett Scouts.</p>

	<p>Our sections are open to both boys and 	girls. scouting is inclusive - if you have any questions or concerns about joining get in touch and we'll see what we can do to help! It doesn't matter
	if you live in Blackhill, Shotley Bridge, Consett, or further afield, you are most welcome to join the adventure.</p>

	<p>If you live in Derwentside we'd love you to join us: whether you are a young person looking for a great way to meet other people and have fun, wanting to help out or add to your CV!</p>

	<p><u></u><a href="Volunteer or Join.htm">Volunteer / Join / Frequently Asked Questions</a></u></p>

	<p>We also have a public facing facebook page-&nbsp;<u><a href="https://www.facebook.com/blackhillscoutgroup"target="_blank">facebook.com/blackhillscoutgroup</a></u>&nbsp;as well as
	private pages for each section.</p>

	<p><b>Scouts is all about fun, challenges and adventure.</b></p>

	<p>Scouts helps children and young adults reach their full potential. Scouts develop skills including teamwork, 
		time management, leadership, initiative, planning, communication, self-motivation, cultural awareness and commitment. 
		We help young people to get jobs, save lives and even change the world.</p>

	<p><b>What do Scouts do?</b></p>

	<p>Scouts take part in activities as diverse as kayaking, abseiling, expeditions overseas, photography, climbing and
	zorbing. As a Scout you can learn survival skills, first aid, computer programming, or even how to fly a plane. 
	There’s something for every young person. It’s a great way to have fun, make friends, get outdoors, express your
	creativity and experience the wider world.</p>

	<p><b>What do volunteers do?</b></p>

	<p>This everyday adventure is possible thanks to our adult volunteers, who support Scouts in a wide range of roles from
	working directly with young people, to helping manage a Group, to being a charity Trustee. We help volunteers get the most 
	out of their experiences at Scouts by providing opportunities for adventure, training, fun and friendship.</p>

	<p>Our award-winning training scheme for volunteers means that adults get as much from Scouts as young people. Our
	approach focuses on what you want to get out of volunteering with Scouts, while respecting how much time you can offer. 
	Over 90% of Scout volunteers say that their skills and experiences have been useful in their work or personal life.</p>
