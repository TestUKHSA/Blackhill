	<p><b>Scouts is all about fun, challenges and adventure.</b></p>

	<p>Scouts helps children and young adults reach their full potential. Scouts develop skills including teamwork, 
		time management, leadership, initiative, planning, communication, self-motivation, cultural awareness and commitment. 
		We help young people to get jobs, save lives and even change the world.</p>

	<p><b>What do Scouts do?</b></p>

	<p>Scouts take part in activities as diverse as kayaking, abseiling, expeditions overseas, photography, climbing and
	zorbing. As a Scout you can learn survival skills, first aid, computer programming, or even how to fly a plane. 
	There’s something for every young person. It’s a great way to have fun, make friends, get outdoors, express your
	creativity and experience the wider world.</p>

	<p><b>What do volunteers do?</b></p>

	<p>This everyday adventure is possible thanks to our adult volunteers, who support Scouts in a wide range of roles from
	working directly with young people, to helping manage a Group, to being a charity Trustee. We help volunteers get the most 
	out of their experiences at Scouts by providing opportunities for adventure, training, fun and friendship.</p>

	<p>Our award-winning training scheme for volunteers means that adults get as much from Scouts as young people. Our
	approach focuses on what you want to get out of volunteering with Scouts, while respecting how much time you can offer. 
	Over 90% of Scout volunteers say that their skills and experiences have been useful in their work or personal life.</p>
