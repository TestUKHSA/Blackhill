<p><b>Scouts is all about fun, challenges and adventure.</b></p>

<p>Scouts helps children and young adults
reach their full potential. Scouts develop skills including teamwork, time
management, leadership, initiative, planning, communication, self-motivation,
cultural awareness and commitment. We help young people to get jobs, save lives
and even change the world.</p>

<p><b>What do Scouts do?</b></p>

<p>Scouts take part in activities as diverse
as kayaking, abseiling, expeditions overseas, photography, climbing and
zorbing. As a Scout you can learn survival skills, first aid, computer
programming, or even how to fly a plane. There’s something for every young
person. It’s a great way to have fun, make friends, get outdoors, express your
creativity and experience the wider world.</p>

<p><b>What do volunteers do?</b></p>

<p>This everyday adventure is possible thanks
to our adult volunteers, who support Scouts in a wide range of roles from
working directly with young people, to helping manage a Group, to being a
charity Trustee. We help volunteers get the most out of their experiences at
Scouts by providing opportunities for adventure, training, fun and friendship.</p>

<p>Our award-winning training scheme for
volunteers means that adults get as much from Scouts as young people. Our
approach focuses on what you want to get out of volunteering with Scouts, while
respecting how much time you can offer. Over 90% of Scout volunteers say that
their skills and experiences have been useful in their work or personal life.</p>

<p><b>&quot;Every child has the right to an adventure&quot;</b></p>
