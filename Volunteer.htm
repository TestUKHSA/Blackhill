<p><h1 style="text-align: center;">We’re Scouting for Talent</h1></p>
<p><h1 style="text-align: center; color:rgb(245, 127, 255);">Do more. Share more. Be more.</p></h2>

<p>There are many ways in which adults can support our group, which of course then supports our young people.  Any role makes you a great supporter for our young people. You shape what you do and the time you have to give. Scouts happens when a lot of us give a little (and no, you don’t have to be a Scout or outdoors expert to volunteer).  Scouting can also build your skills, CV and networks.</p>

<a href="link" style="text-align: center"></a><p><img id="vol-notpictured" src="assets/images/vol-notpictured.png" alt="Not pictured: the mini bus driver, the sandwich maker, the photo taker" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 5px;max-width: 100%"></p></a>

<p>Roles within Scouts can be varied, we all have something we can share. It could be every week with our groups or just occasionally. Or it could be behind the scenes - helping to keep it all going.</p>

<p>Begin your journey by simply having a chat to a leader, helper or a trustee.  Scouts, Cubs and Beavers meet each Tuesday during term time to have fun, learn and develop skills for life.</p>

<p>Can you help us to run our Beaver, Cub of Scout meetings as part of our Occasional Helper rota?  You might:</p>

<ul type=disc>
    <li>get stuck-in helping to run games and activities, excitement building, smile inducing, craft constructing, chocolate crispy cake making, photo taking, event organising superstar…</li>
    <li>You could directly help run one of the sections on an occasional basis, on rota or more regularly.  </li>
    <li>help with some of the housekeeping needed to run our sessions.  who will be leading the sessions.</li>
    <li>demonstrate a skill you have and run a session based upon it with support from our Section Leaders</li>
</ul>

<a href="link" style="text-align: center"><p><img id="vol-rolemodel" src="assets/images/vol-rolemodel.png" alt="You look like a role model" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 5px;max-width: 100%"></p></a>

<p>Our supporting Exec Committee meets every month or two to ensure the leaders are supported, the group is well managed and to look after administration of the scout group / charity.  Can you help us with the administration of the group.  Roles could include social media, fundraising, tracking booking and spending, ensuring the group is running correctly and reporting to the Charity Commission.</p>
<p>You can commit to help as much as you want to - maybe once a month for an hour or two one evening, or maybe during a weekend activity or residential event.  Maybe you want to help more often.  Just let us know what works for you, and keep us updated if things change!</p>
