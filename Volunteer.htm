<p><q>For anyone thinking of becoming a Scout, I say, go for it, come and join the big adventure.</q></p>
<p>Bear Grylls, UK Chief Scout</p>  
<p>We are based in Derwentside, providing fun, challenge, and everyday adventure to young people from 6 - 14.  
    Scouts provides more adventurous activity to more young people than any other charity in the UK, which is remarkable considering it is run entirely by volunteers. 
    Without your help, we can't make it happen.  We hope to provide flexible volunteering that everyone can take part in and enjoy.  
    We're always looking for volunteers! If you think you could offer us some of your time - 
    however much - please get in touch  - either come along and speak to one of the leaders or email us at scouts@blackhill.org.uk</p>
<p>Could you help run occasional activities or support the leaders at weekly sessions for our bubbly 6–8 year olds in Beavers or the older children in Cubs or Scouts?  
    Could you help with the management of the group or our new, soon to be opened HQ building, with administration, fundraising or training?</p>
<p>Achieve amazing things as a Scouting volunteer your local community today.   You’ll take part in things you’d never expect to do. 
You’ll develop skills employers look for, and helping young people to improve their lives and reach their potential makes it all worthwhile.</p>
<p>Scouting offers fun and friendship, challenge and everyday adventure for our 100,000 volunteers and 
    400,000 girls and boys in Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers across the UK, whatever their physical ability, faith or community background.</p>
<p>A study found that over 90% of our volunteers believe that the skills and experiences they have gained through Scouting have been of relevance to their working or personal lives, such as:</p>
<ul type=disc>
    <li>Improving your confidence, teamwork and leadership skills</li>
    <li>Learning to support and manage</li>
    <li>Discovering hidden talents like fundraising, media relations and event management></li>
    <li>Developing administrative skills as a Scouting Secretary or Treasurer</li>
    <li>Getting active and having lots of fun too!</li>
    <li>Have the chance to gain externally recognised qualifications></li>
</ul>
<p>We need more people like you to volunteer a little bit of your time.  You don’t need any Scouting experience. You won’t have to wear a uniform.   
    With full support and training, you can experience the fun, friendship and adventure of Scouting for yourself, all on a flexible basis.  Whether you help out once a fortnight, month or term or just at special events or camps, there is bound to be a role you can play.</p>
