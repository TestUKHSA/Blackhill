<h1>Uniforms & Badges</h1>
<p>You can get a wide range of uniforms and accessories from the Moor House Adventure Centre in Durham, DH4 6QY or at shop.scouts.org.uk. 
You can also get a limited range from some major stores, e.g. Salto in Prudhoe (NE42 6PL, suggest you ring first to check stock 01661 835 240, 
https://saltouk.com/index.php?route=common/home) or the uniform section of John Lewis in Newcastle.</p>
<p>A uniform is not necessary until a young person is invested, typically after a few weeks, when they're sure they are happy and they formally join the group. 
Before you buy a uniform speak to the leader about what is essential.  Upon investment a new member is presented with their necker and woggle and the group, district and county badges.</p>
<p>If upon leaving the group or transitioning between sections you wish to recycle a uniform please give it to a section leader and it will be given free to anyone who asks. 
On moving up e.g. beavers to cubs etc, you can sew badges earned in previous sections onto a camp blanket.</p>
