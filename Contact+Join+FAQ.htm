<p></p>Scouts is all about fun, challenges and adventure.

<p>Scouts helps children and young adults reach their full potential. 
  Scouts develop skills including teamwork, time management, leadership, initiative, planning, communication, self-motivation, cultural awareness and commitment. 
  We help young people to get jobs, save lives and even change the world.</p>

<h2>What do Scouts do?</h2>

<p>Scouts take part in activities as diverse as kayaking, abseiling, expeditions overseas, photography, climbing and zorbing. 
  As a Scout you can learn survival skills, first aid, computer programming, or even how to fly a plane. 
  There’s something for every young person. It’s a great way to have fun, make friends, get outdoors, express your creativity and experience the wider world.</p>

<h2>What do volunteers do?</h2>

<p>This everyday adventure is possible thanks to our adult volunteers, who support Scouts in a wide range of roles from working directly with young people, 
  to helping manage a Group, to being a charity Trustee. We help volunteers get the most out of their experiences at Scouts by providing opportunities for adventure, training, fun and friendship.</p>

<p>Our award-winning training scheme for volunteers means that adults get as much from Scouts as young people. 
  Our approach focuses on what you want to get out of volunteering with Scouts, while respecting how much time you can offer. 
  Over 90% of Scout volunteers say that their skills and experiences have been useful in their work or personal life.</p>

<h2>Is there a waiting list?</h2>

<p>Usually yes there is for Beavers, sometimes for Cubs, but generally not for Scouts. 
  The main reason for a waiting list is due to ensuring we have the required ratio of leaders / parents to children and this ratio is highest for Beavers. 
  Also some activities such as outdoor events cannot take place without additional adult support, so we ask that you support the group and leaders wherever you can. 
  You don't have to be a parent of a beaver, cub or scout to support us - it is very rewarding, doesn't take too much time and can build skills and CVs.</p>

<p>Please tell us can you help the group? If so you will get prioritised as adult helpers are the limiting factor for group size.</p>

<p>Are you happy to support the leader on a rota or more often?</p>

<p>Are you happy to plan and deliver any particular activities - this might be crafts or games or any of the scouting badges e.g. learning about a different culture, cooking, first aid, sewing, IT etc - speak to a leader.</p>

<h2>How much does does it cost?</h2>

<p>Subscriptions "Subs" are £10 every month by direct debit which is equal to £20 per half term. 
  Subs pay towards hall usage costs, badges and activity materials, insurance and annual capitation fees (approx £45 per member) which we need to pay to Scouting. 
  There are additional costs for camps, depending on facilities and activities. 
  Payments are managed via OSM (Online Scout Manager) which the leaders will set up for you and allows them to minimise session time lost to collecting money. 
  For new starters you would normally pay only after your first week. 
  Please, if any parent can complete the gift aid section of the essential information form, it makes a big difference to the group. 
  Scouting is voluntary, we are a charity and give our time freely for the benefit of the children in our / your scout group. If you can help us fundraise do discuss with any of the leaders.</p>

<h2>Is a uniform required for new starters?</h2>

<p>No, although scouting is a uniformed organisation, new starters would normally attend in activity clothes and once they are happy that they wish to join then a uniform would be needed. 
  A uniform is required for investment, when a new member formally joins and is presented with the group badges and necker, 
  which is usually after a few weeks - the section leader will let you know in advance.</p>

<p>For more information about uniforms and where to purchase see the section: Shop + Uniforms + badges</p>

<p>If you have want to learn more about the group and have more questions answered, see your welcome pack in: Resources, Forms & Welcome Pack</p>

<h2>Can I hire the headquarters building for parties or other one off functions or regular events?</h2>

<p>Yes of course, and you can get a discount for regular events or for parties for section members. See the section HQ hire for more information Building hire for parties or regular bookings</p>
